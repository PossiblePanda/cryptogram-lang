Hello, welcome to the official *Cryptogram* Documentation page.
On this page, we will show you how to speak, and write in *Cryptogram*, and hopefully do it fluently. This language is ran, and maintained by @PossiblePanda, and @ImSoBored420

## Alphabet

All of the letters in the *Cryptogram* alphabet are based on English letters. This means *Cryptogram* can easily be translated from English.

Here is an image of the *Cryptogram* Alphabet, and the translations.

## Pronunciations

When pronouncing *Cryptogram* Sentences there is one big rule. If you are pronouncing a word with two of the same letters next to eachother, then you pronounce it as if there is one. When pronouncing a word / sentence, you combine all of the sounds. For example, the word Hi would be pronounced (tay-pa), because H is tay, and I, is pa.
