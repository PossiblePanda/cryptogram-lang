# Cryptogram Language
Hello, welcome to the official *Cryptogram* Documentation page.
On this page, we will show you how to speak, and write in *Cryptogram*, and hopefully do it fluently. This language is ran, and maintained by @PossiblePanda, and @ImSoBored420

## Alphabet

All of the letters in the *Cryptogram* alphabet are based on English letters. This means *Cryptogram* can easily be translated from English.

Here is an image of the Cryptogram Alphabet, and the translations
